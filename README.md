# ObjectOrientatedIntelligence
👋 Hello! Here is a project I made for CAB201: Programming Principles. 
The focus was on utilisting objective orientated programming to create a terminal game, using C#.
This was my first time using C# and my most complicated programming project so far.

The program uses object orientated theory such as inheritance, abstaction and polymorphism to create a game
which is easliy scaleable, efficent and readable.
